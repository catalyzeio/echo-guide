                        <p>In part 2 of our healthcare innovators series, Catalyze co-founder &amp; president Mohan Balachandran continues his conversations with Grahame Grieve ("The Father of FHIR"). Grahame specializes in healthcare interoperability, balancing clinical, management and business perspectives, using his deep technical knowledge and capability. </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><em>Question 1 (Mohan):</em> Can you talk about the rationale behind the creation of FHIR?</p>
                        <blockquote>
                        <p>“I believe that it was necessary to create a new set of standards that actually solved the problems people have. Fundamentally, that's why we did it.”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><em>Question 2 (Mohan):</em> What problems was FHIR designed to solve, or that HL7 couldn't solve before?</p>
                        <blockquote>
                        <p>“HL7's context was not around exchanging data, or if it was, it was very limited circumstances; it was hard to leverage and wasn't flexible. I wanted to set that flexibility free so people could write apps to do interesting things with data that other people held.”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><em>Question 3 (Mohan):</em> FHIR seems to be very patient centric and all the associated resources around it. Is that how you are thinking about it — that the patient should be at the center of all the data models and data exchanges?</p>
